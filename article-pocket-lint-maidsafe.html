          <h1>MaidSafe is the internet re-born: Faster, safer, cheaper and totally anonymous</h1>
          <p>14 February 2014 </p>
          <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127240-maidsafe-is-the-internet-re-born-faster-safer-cheaper-and-totally-anonymous" target="_blank"><img src="images/pr-pocket-lint-maidsafe.png" class="responsive pr-image" /></a>
           <p>It's difficult to write this without hyperbole, but MaidSafe could  potentially re-invent the internet much in the way apps changed  software. A decentralised network that's totally secure, anonymous, and  free for everyone to build on. Is this the beginning of the end for the  current internet?</p>
<p>MaidSafe is essentially a set of super intelligent algorithms  developed over the last seven years. This self-regulating network lets  users offer spare drive space and in return delivers anonymous,  super-fast internet.</p>
<p>Imagine a country under the rule of a dictatorship with the freedom  to speak out without the government being able to stop or even track  individuals. The implications for freedom are great but so too are those  for criminals. Before we get into that though, what exactly is  MaidSafe?</p>
<h3>Safer surfing</h3>
<p>Currently data, like one of your documents or a website, is stored in  big server farms that need expensive cooling to run and are reasonably  easy to hack. MaidSafe is different. It will break up that file and put  its pieces, encrypted above military level, on different machines all  over the globe - owned by individuals (you, even) that have signed up to  the service. Even if each of the pieces were found they'd be useless  without the tying glue to put them all back together again in the right  order.</p>
<p>And because you sign-in with a unique key even the MaidSafe network  itself can't find the data unless it's you accessing it. When you log  out, that data effectively doesn't exist any more, until you're back  online.</p>
<img src="images/pocket-lint-maidsafe-01.png" class="responsive" />
<p>But what if someone goes offline and I can't get my document? Not a  problem. There are always four copies on four different continents at  any one time. So if a person goes offline, MaidSafe automatically copies  one of the other three and redistributes a fourth. To lose any data  four entire continents would need to go offline at once. That should  ensure MaidSafe data is more secure than cloud services that rely on  dedicated servers.</p>
<h3>Faster finds</h3>
<p>MaidSafe is faster than the current internet too and impervious to  DDoS attacks. A Distributed Denial of Service attack is when a hacker  kills a server by hitting it with so many page requests it collapses.  However, when the "server" is made up spare space on hundreds of  thousands of <a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/?&_nkw=home+computers" target="_blank" data-skimwords-id="815094" data-skimwords-word="home%20computers" data-group-id="0" data-skim-creative="302003" data-skim-product="815094" title="Shopping Link Added by SkimWords">home computers</a> around the globe, it is near impossible to attack them all simultaneously. </p>
<img src="images/pocket-lint-maidsafe-02.png" class="responsive" />
<p>In terms of web speed, MaidSafe caches a website locally, creating a  copy each time it is viewed. The more it is viewed the more it's cached  and the greater number of locations to draw that website from therefore.  That means the more popular a site is the faster it will actually  run. It's not dependent on a user accessing just one server and the  bandwidth of the one firm.</p>
<p>With the pooled resources of so many computers it creates a sort of  "mega-computer", says MaidSafe. "Usually 90 to 95 per cent of data is  shared in an enterprise. So MaidSafe can wipe out 95 per cent of stuff  because it's currently duplicated all over the current internet."</p>
<h3>Freedom to build</h3>
<p>One of the potentially exciting features of this network is the lack  of physical infrastructure. This means developers can get their apps and  ideas up and running, on a huge scale, without spending a penny. This  levels the playing field between big companies and the independent  creators who, currently, might not be able to compete due to a lack of  funds to rent storage space for their projects.</p>
<p>Since there are no servers, and unlimited space, MaidSafe lets users create any app or system they want for free.</p>
<p>And the lack of server maintenance means could mean it is better for the environment and save companies billions of dollars. </p>
<img src="images/pocket-lint-maidsafe-03.png" class="responsive" />
<p>One of the first apps, due out later this month, will be a Dropbox  style offering. But since it relies merely on popularity rather than  servers, the potential storage for each person is unlimited. And it's  more secure than anything on offer using the current internet.</p>
<p>MaidSafe plans to offer everything for free but will take just a one  per cent fee where a development is making revenue. "We want to work  with third parties otherwise we'll have far too much power than one  company should ever be allowed - it will end up working against us,"  Pocket-lint was told.</p>
<h3>Future gazing</h3>
<p>The company's ultimate goal is to have everything on MaidSafe.  Everything. Like a suped-up version of the cloud. All hardware, be they  tablets, phones, smart glasses or computers will become dumb terminals.  Whatever you use will just need a sign-in password or retinal scan  perhaps, and your entire operating system will be there just as you left  it on a totally different device.</p>
<p>But since this network is totally anonymous and untraceable, how will  search work? MaidSafe told us it's going to leave this up to third  parties like Google so they can choose how they'd prefer it to work. But  policing the network is another issue that must be considered -  otherwise serious criminals such as child abusers and paedophile  rings are free to do as they please.</p>
<p>MaidSafe addressed the point while talking to Pocket-lint, but not in  the way that will appease both sides of the free speech argument.  "Anonymity, either you have it or you don't - there's no halfway house,"  the company explained.</p>
<p>"It&rsquo;s a bit like a kitchen knife manufacturer who makes really great  sharp knives to cut bread, but then finds that his product was used in a  knife attack."</p>
<p>MaidSafe is designed with a logic system in place that offers  anonymity and total freedom, to everyone. It offers potential for a more  level internet that sticks to freedom of speech and anonymity for all.  But at the potential cost of giving freedom to bad folk too. Not  everyone will subscribe to that ideal, but it will be interesting to see  how many do.</p>
