         	<p>We like to think of MaidSafe as a frictionless decentralized development platform</p>
            <p>How would you like to create the next Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Candy Crush, or secure email service?</p>
            <p>The MaidSafe platform offers every developer the opportunity to create applications without any infrastructure costs and without any barrier to entry. Experience customer acquisition costs that are just limited to marketing and 1% of your revenue, only payable once your app starts to generate income.</p>
            <p>Build your next business on a network that will enable you to outperform all incumbents, that can automatically adapt in real-time to demand fluctuations, which also allows you to offer anonymity, security and privacy to all your users.</p>
            <p><strong>The MaidSafe network API is being finalised now, join us and decide on your venture, we will help make your vision a reality.</strong></p>
            <p>Reasons for developing on the MaidSafe platform:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Get your apps everywhere</li>
              <li>No risk - you only start to make a minimal payment (1% of revenue) as your app starts to earn revenue, not before!</li>
              <li> No API key - just download our code and start using it</li>
              <li>Extremely low customer acquisition costs and no infrastructure costs</li>
              <li>Apps that adapt in real-time to changes in demand</li>
              <li>Provide security, privacy and anonymity to all your users</li>
            </ul>
