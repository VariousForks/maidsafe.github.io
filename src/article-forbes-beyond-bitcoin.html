          <h1>Beyond Bitcoin: Crypto-Ownership Companies Hope You're Ready To Decentralize Everything On The Internet</h1>
          <p>8 April 2014</p>
           <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/04/08/beyond-bitcoin-crypto-ownership-companies-hope-youre-ready-to-decentralize-everything-on-the-internet/" target="_blank"><img src="images/pr-forbes-bitcoin-beyond.png" alt="Forbes" class="responsive pr-image" /></a>
      <p>David Irvine lives in a tiny beach town called Troon on the West  Coast of Scotland. He describes it as a place where old people go to  retire, with a population of 15,000, a thriving golf community and views  of the cliffs of Ireland on a clear day. It's a surprising place from  which to launch a product that he hopes will transform the way the  Internet works.</p>
<p>Irvine is a mechanical engineer who taught himself about computers  when he "realized they would be big." He went on to manage oil company  Saudi Aramco's computer network before founding his own network  consulting company, Alba, in the UK. After realizing that "the way the  Internet is designed is insane," he unplugged and started sailing,  eventually becoming a yachtmaster who would pick up newly bought boats,  say in the south of France, and sail them home to their owners in the  UK. In 2006, he moved to a place where no English was spoken (so he  could concentrate) to write the white paper for "<a href="http://maidsafe.net/">MaidSafe</a>": a network for crypto-ownership and storage that does for data what <a href="http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/secret-money-living-on-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> does for value. Over the last eight years, he's gotten $5 million in  funding from family and friends to hire 14 people and try to make his  product a reality. This month, the company is doing its first public  funding round. Highly non-traditional, it plans to raise funds by  issuing "Safecoins" on a cryptocurrency protocol called <a href="http://www.mastercoin.org/">Mastercoin</a>, which itself is built on top of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Confused yet? Welcome to the age of crypto-ownership, where any kind  of data can be encrypted and managed by a decentralized network of  computers. It's a concept that's been around for years as readers of  sci-fi authors like Neal Stephenson know, but now that Bitcoin has  managed to permeate the public consciousness and introduce people to the  concept of a decentralized, crypto-managed network in a tangible,  money-generating way, other crypto-entrepeneurs are hoping to move  beyond just decentralizing payment. Their models look a lot like  Bitcoin, but instead of eliminating banks and the Federal Reserve, they  have other service providers in their targets. A company called Ethereum  headed by a lanky Canadian named Vitalik Buterin, 20, wants to  decentralize contracts, allowing deeds, car titles, or even something  like Social Security numbers to be stored in a network, where one person  crypto-owns the contract with a private key until they choose to pass  it along to someone else (like you would pass along a Bitcoin). "It's  the sharing economy for your hard drive," he says.</p>
<p>Bitshares and MasterCoin want to decentralize the stock market and  the IPO process, so that a company can issue shares or raise money on a  decentralized network by issuing crypto-tokens that investors can later  cash in, trade, or use to participate in a company's services. (This  idea is already geeting a close look from the SEC, which has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-03-19/gambling-website-s-bitcoin-denominated-stock-draws-sec-inquiry">voiced concerns about bitcoin stock exchanges</a>.)  And MaidShare wants a network of user who will download software that  will cause their computers to give up to 90% of the unused storage, CPU  and bandwidth on their computers to help maintain a decentralized  storage network. It's like a botnet, but one where the bots get paid for  their troubles. The leasing of their computer power will result in the  generation of SafeCoins, just like Bitcoin "miners" who keep track of  the Bitcoin network get rewarded with the generation of Bitcoin, except  Irvine calls his participants "farmers."</p>
<p>MaidSafe will start with a network of just 60 computers. Their  Mastercoin fundraiser on April 22 will release over 400 million  Safecoins (with a plan to cap the total at 4.3 billion, and save 5% of  them their initial investors); they hope to raise $8 million. A person  who gives them 1 Bitcoin (or $450) will get approximately 17,000  Safecoins. They plan to use the funds to support their work over the  next 3 years, buy more computing nodes, and start creating applications  on the Safemaid network such as a decentralized Dropbox app. It would  work by splitting a file into "encrypted shards" with many copies  distributed over the network (so if one person turns their computer off,  you're not out of luck in retrieving the document). They hope a  thriving ecosystem will develop on Maidsafe; they're setting aside 10%  of all Safecoins to go to people who build open source apps. App  creators will get paid out according to how widely used their apps are.</p>
