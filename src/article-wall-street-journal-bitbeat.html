          <h1>BitBeat: Rep. Stockman Wants IRS to Reconsider Bitcoin Decision</h1>

  <h3>From the Inside Bitcoins Conference:</h3>
  <p>- <strong>Rep. Steve Stockman (R, Texas) was at the Inside Bitcoins conference</strong> in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, sharing a bill he plans to introduce  in Congress asking the IRS to reconsider its decision earlier this month  declaring <a href="http://live.wsj.com/video/what-a-bitcoin/D79FF38C-7816-435B-B3B0-F9B177BCA0A8.html" data-ls-seen="1">bitcoin</a> property for tax purposes.</p>
  <p>The bill currently is a draft, a mere one page, directing the IRS to  treat bitcoin as currency for tax purposes. Of course, the goal of the bill isn&rsquo;t necessarily to get Congress to codify bitcoin into law. Rep.  Stockman, an aficionado who accepted bitcoin donations for his  reelection campaign, is looking to get a conversation going on the  topic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s not accurate,&rdquo; he said of the IRS ruling. To him,  bitcoin is not a commodity, but a currency. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sugar, it&rsquo;s not  gold.&rdquo; Rep. Stockman concedes to one major problem: There is still much  debate, even at the conference, about what bitcoin actually is. He suggested we go into the conference and ask 10 different people, much  like he did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get 10 different answers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regardless, he plans to introduce his bill later this month.  Understanding how slowly Congress moves, and knowing how few of his  fellow lawmakers are up on developments in digital currency (if not  outright hostile), he isn&rsquo;t necessarily looking for action there. What  he really wants is just to stir up debate on the question, in the hope  that the IRS changes its stance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The IRS can act quicker than Congress,&rdquo; he said. <em>(Paul Vigna)</em></p>
  <p><strong>-Bitcoin is entering the &ldquo;multi-sig&rdquo; era. </strong>Mt. Gox&rsquo;s  bankruptcy and its announcement that it had lost 650,000 bitcoins has  fixated the bitcoin community on a problem in real need of a fix: the  vulnerability of their &ldquo;digital wallets&rdquo; to theft and hacking attacks.</p>
  <p>Many believe the solution lies in multi-signature technology, also  known as &ldquo;multi sig,&rdquo; in which digital coins cannot be released from the  wallet  unless more than one private key – a unique alphanumeric code  that&rsquo;s used to digitally &ldquo;sign&rdquo; encrypted transactions — is applied to  it.</p>
  <p>Now it appears that San Francisco-based wallet provider BitGo has won  the race to deliver a mainstream multi-sig wallet. BitGo will generate  three different keys for each wallet customer, one that&rsquo;s attached to  the live, online wallet and controlled by the owner, one that&rsquo;s held in  an encrypted format by BitGo, and a third that&rsquo;s held offline in  so-called &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo; by the owner. Two of the three keys will need  to be signed to complete any transaction.</p>
  <p>BitGo launched its wallet at the Inside Bitcoins conference and won  an endorsements from Bitcoin payment processor Bitpay, which said it  plans to promote the BitGo wallet to its 27,000 merchant customers.</p>
  <p>Will O&rsquo;Brien, BitGo Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, said he  expects &ldquo;the majority of exchanges and the majority of bitcoin holders  moving to multi sig, both because of the high security and the ease of  use.&rdquo;  <em>(Michael Casey) </em></p>
  <p>- <strong>MaidSafe is looking to do to the Internet what bitcoin</strong> is doing to money: decentralizing it. The startup unveiled a project at  the conference that it&rsquo;s been working on for eight years: Essentially, a  new, decentralized Internet that offers cryptocurrency enthusiasts a  new alt-coin, called safecoin, that is a feature of the system.</p>
  <p>The new system, which the company plans to launch on April 22, mimics  some of the characteristics of bitcoin: in essence, it replaces the  myriad servers that currently host the World Wide Web and replaces it  with a decentralized system in which the entire web is hosted among the  network&rsquo;s users&rsquo; computers.</p>
  <p>The system is the brainchild of Scottish engineer David Irvine, who  said he was inspired by the sort of systems (an ant colony, for  instance) found in nature. &ldquo;Nature is the ultimate decentralized  system,&rdquo; he said to MoneyBeat during a conversation in the press room  during a break.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;re not going to get into the complexities of the system, which you can <a data-ls-seen="1" href="http://maidsafe.net/" target="_blank">explore here</a>. Suffice it to say we were intrigued. <em>(Paul Vigna)</em></p>
