          <h1>MaidSafe Announces New Project to Decentralize the Internet</h1>
          <p>8 April 2014</p>
           <a href="https://coinreport.net/maidsafe-project-decentralize-internet/" target="_blank"><img src="images/pr-coin-report.png" alt="CoinReport" class="responsive pr-image" /></a>
           <p><a href="http://maidsafe.net/" target="_blank">MaidSafe</a> has just announced at <a href="https://coinreport.net/inside-bitcoins-new-york-city-2014-event-preparations/" target="_blank">Inside Bitcoins NY</a> its new project of revolutionizing the internet to become more safe and  secure to use. The goal is to make the internet decentralized,  independent and anonymous similar to the working of the digital currency  known as <a href="https://coinreport.net/coin-101/bitcoin/" target="_blank">bitcoin</a>.</p>
  <p>The  project has utilized $5 million and has been in the works for about  eight years now. In order to fund this new internet advancement,  MaidSafe is introducing its own digital currency called safecoin.</p>
  <h2>MaidSafe &ldquo;Bitcoin-Like Internet&rdquo;</h2>
  <p>MaidSafe  founder and CEO, David Irvine and MaidSafe&rsquo;s COO and co-founder of  Project SAFE, Nick Lambert, have presented their invention during the <a href="https://coinreport.net/inside-bitcoins-new-york-city-2014-event-preparations/" target="_blank">Inside Bitcoin NY</a> at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center today. The intention behind  project SAFE aka Secure Access For Everyone is to decentralize every  aspect of the internet including all the web services.</p>
  <p>By making  safecoin, it will remove any need of having a mediator in network  transactions. Basically, what bitcoin has brought to the table in  regards to decentralizing the monetary system, safecoin will do that for  all internet services. Lambert said,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;At the root of  it all, we want to put people back in control of their data â€” not  Google, Facebook or other large corporations. Why put up with Google ads  you don&rsquo;t want and why ask DropBox permission to access your own files?  It&rsquo;s about liberty and freedom. This is the Internet sans frontiers!&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>April 22 will be the opening of a thirty day crowd-sale for Project SAFE and will take place at <a href="http://www.safecoin.io/" target="_blank">safecoin.io</a>.  10% of all safecoins will be made accessible to buyers from around the  world through an alternative token called the MaidSafeCoin during this  event. As soon as the MaidSafe network goes live to its users, the  MaidSafeCoins will be convertible to safecoins at a one to one ratio.</p>
  <p>With  the decentralization of the Internet, SAFE will introduce a host of  different advantages. For examples, users of the internet will be able  to conduct private and secure communications. The decentralized network  will replace HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc., and will be safe from DNS influence  and works. People will be able to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwgeeks/article/MaidSafe-Prepares-for-Safecoin-Crowd-Sale-to-Facilitate-Decentralized-Internet-20140408" target="_blank">self-authenticate</a> onto the network and join anonymously.&rdquo; The network will be secure with  no need for a third party intervention including administrators.</p>
  <p>This  is indeed exciting news for the internet enthusiasts and digital  currency advocates. To learn more about the MaidSafe technology, do  watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGH40oUVDY" target="_blank">this short video</a> explaining the subject.</p>
