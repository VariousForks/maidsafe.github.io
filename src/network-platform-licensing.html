            <h1>Licensing</h1>
            <p>As with the Internet today, the MaidSafe network cannot be owned or controlled by anyone, it’s OURs, all of us. The SAFE network is completely anonymous, secure and repels human intervention of any kind, it cannot be controlled or ‘owned’. All MaidSafe code is available under GPL V3. This license is available at the foot of this page or on the GNU website <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>.</p>
            <p>MaidSafe uses an Open Source license because we believe that the potential for the SAFE network to become so pervasive throughout peoples lives, means that no person, company or organisation should own the technology. It should be there for everyone to use as they see fit (and always will be) and can be forked at any time. We also feel that being Open Source leads to greater audit-ability of the software and while this isn’t obviously a guarantee that a piece of code is well written or secure, it  provides the opportunity for knowledgeable and open peer review and public debate.</p>
            <p>All our libraries can be found in GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/maidsafe">https://github.com/maidsafe</a>) and there is plenty of support available, either through our developer mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maidsafe-development">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maidsafe-development</a>) or via our community run forum (<a href="https://www.maidsafe.org/">https://www.maidsafe.org/</a>).</p>
