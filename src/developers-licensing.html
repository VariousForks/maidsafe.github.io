            <h1>Licensing</h1>
            <p>As with the Internet today, the MaidSafe network cannot be owned or controlled by anyone, it’s OURs, all of us. MaidSafe is completely anonymous, secure and repels human intervention of any kind, it cannot be controlled or ‘owned’. MaidSafe are Open Source
  with all our code available under GPL3. This means that we don’t own it, it is there for everyone to use (and always will be) and can be forked independently from MaidSafe.</p>
            <p>MaidSafe will also not judge any developers app, banning those that either compete or don’t meet some quality standard. We take a simpler approach. We let market forces decide, if an app is of poor quality it will not be used. We are confident that this
              approach will entice developers and companies to work with us. Both the GPL and our Commercial license provides developers with the comfort of patent protection for their products. The fact that we are Open Source will also encourage collaboration through
              transparency as developers can check the source code for themselves rather than relying on anything we have to say about it.</p>
            <p>Please email all completed Commercial licenses to: <a href="mailto:licensing@maidsafe.net">licensing@maidsafe.net</a>.
