          <p>The MaidSafe ( &ldquo;Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone&rdquo; ) vision is to replace today&rsquo;s existing server centric and intrusive systems with a fully distributed, safe, secure and private network.  The MaidSafe network is completely anonymous, secure and aims to repel human intervention of any kind; it cannot be controlled or &lsquo;owned&rsquo;. MaidSafe&rsquo;s intelligent algorithms developed over the last seven years. This self-regulating network lets users offer spare drive space and in return delivers anonymous, super-fast internet. MaidSafe could potentially re-invent the internet much in the way apps changed software.</p>
<p>The MaidSafe platform provides a distributed network that allows developers to create fast and secure applications of any kind. With no API key to be purchased and no infrastructure required, developers are not exposed to any financial risk with significantly reduced customer acquisition costs.Developers can get their apps and ideas up and running, on a huge scale, without spending a penny. This levels the playing field between big companies and the independent creators who, currently, might not be able to compete due to a lack of funds to rent storage space for their projects.</p>
<p>When ever a data is entered it will be splitted to many pieces by the MaidSafe scripts and then distributed to many computers around the globe. Those pieces of data will be encrypted with the highest level encryption that is better than military grade. So even if each of the pieces were found they&rsquo;d be useless without the programs to put them all back together again in the right order. So it is safer than current server centric system, where the data is kept as full document behind firewalls of data centers. When the security is breached  all data will be compromised.</p>
<p>The network keeps and maintains 4 copies of each encrypted chunk and moves these fragments around the network as nodes become unavailable, either through failure or power down. In order to cope with this churn, the network is able to reconfigure globally extremely quickly (possibly as fast as 20 milliseconds). These steps ensure data is always available, provided the user retrieving the data has an Internet connection and the correct credentials.</p>
<p> Benefits  of  The MaidSafe  are</p>

    <h2>No Servers -</h2>
    <p>Means no worries about data centres, server security, Impervious to web censoring (no DNS), Denial of Service attacks rendered invalid via opportunistic caching - <a href="http://maidsafe.net/opportunistic-caching">See diagram</a>, Unlimited data storage with no monetary cost and no transactions</p>
    <h2>No Administrators – Only Users</h2>
    <p>Network automatically configures and reconfigures in near real time, Privacy and data protection via thousands of algorithms on hundreds of nodes working in tandem, Network decides in real time where data is stored, Data caches close to users in real time, Remove need for network provisioning and planning</p>
    <h2>Data Management Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Invisible to users, all data is encrypted in real time, Real time data de-duplication, reduces amount of data stored, Real time replication, recovery and corruption repair, Geographic distribution of &lsquo;replicant&rsquo; data (allowing mass network outage at zero loss), Cryptographically secure signatures and key&rsquo;s ensure ownership, Nobody has access to anyone else&rsquo;s data unless specifically shared</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Password and Key Security</h2>
    <p>100% protection against passwords being stolen in transit (they are never transmitted), Three (minimum) distinct system areas with separate keys and IDs (no network link between them), Login to system with username, pin and password, Store, retrieve and manipulate your data with another ID (cryptographic key set), Communicate with others through another ID, For every private share, another key chain is created and shared.</p>
    <h2>Share any Kind of Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create private shares between friends and colleagues (instantly and securely), Create any number of public shares for public data (thin web sites), Create micro-blogging systems, Create social networking systems, Share anything, music, programmes, photos, even operating systems with no size limits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Distribute Applications</h2>
    <p>Allow enormous apps on the smallest of devices, Share processing, storage and memory across the network, distributing each of them automatically, Structured data versioning allows roll back, automatic and manual merging as appropriate to your application.</p>
