          <h1>New network could &lsquo;revolutionise&rsquo; the Internet by eliminating viruses, hacking and surveillance</h1>
          <p>29 January 2014 </p>
          <a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2014/01/29/scottish-company-plans-revolutionise-internet/" target="_blank"><img src="images/pr-revolutionise-internet.png" alt="Article in ITProPortal" class="responsive pr-image" /></a>
           <p>A small team of developers has created a secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer network, which some scientists claim will &rdquo;revolutionise&rdquo; the Internet.</p>
            <p>Following eight years of development, Scottish company <a href="http://maidsafe.net/" target="_blank">MaidSafe</a> is on the brink of public beta testing for a network that offers a &rdquo;paradigm change&rdquo; in encryption and data storage systems,
              effectively eliminating the need for terms like 'back-up', 'virus' and 'synchronise'.</p>
            <p>It is not the first time developers have claimed to offer a decentralized Internet. Most recently, a project called Bitcloud announced that it was creating a &rdquo;new mesh network to replace the internet&rdquo;.</p>

            </p>
            <p>However, MaidSafe claims to be one step ahead of the rest. Founder David Irvine has touted the network as a &rdquo;world first&rdquo; in the way it &rdquo;creates security by logic and mathematics.&rdquo;</p>
